How We Moderate We have a dedicated team of trained moderators working around the clock.If you want to reach them to report offensive contributions, always use the inappropriate content reporting link, which can be found next to any entry created by our Users.We ask that you always log in to file these reports.This ensures that we know the exact location of the content complained about, and it helps us prevent campaigns that target individuals anonymously. When reporting about another User’s contribution, make sure you state why you think it breached our Agreement or House Rules.Disagreement with someone’s views is not a reason to report them. When we receive your complaint, we will evaluate it and decide on the most suitable action.We will not normally confirm the steps we take to the complainant, as this may breach the rights and privacy of others, but rest assured that all complaints will be checked promptly and professionally. In some cases, we may have to remove an entire segment of content, including messages that do not breach our terms, if they were part of a topic that was in breach of our Agreement or House Rules, or where the context is lost or does not make sense once we removed offensive content.For example, if we remove a racist comment, the responses to it will no longer be relevant. Images of children are strictly regulated on our service.We allow them but must ensure that they comply with strict guidelines, including that they should not be sexualised in any way, and that they are posted by the child’s immediate family.In many cases we find that parents or relatives upload pictures of their children in good faith, unaware that these might be copied and misused, or that there are privacy issues around their use on the Internet.We remove them in the best interest of the child, and to protect the parents.Unfortunately, we can’t always tell for sure if a picture is that of a minor and, when in doubt, we’d rather err on the side of caution.
