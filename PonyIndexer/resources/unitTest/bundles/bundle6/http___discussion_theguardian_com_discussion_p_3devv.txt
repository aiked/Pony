We have an English language which dominates 99.9% of activity and a minority of Celtic languages. Of course a substantial ethnic minority could easily change things, it's only 500,000 people out of 52 million, less than 1%.

The start of the decline of the British Empire was the consequence of winning the war. As for particular battles, the Poles and others assisted in the Allied attempt.

Furthermore as Britain split the atom, invented the jet engine and radar, all in the 1930's we probably would've "won" it all by ourselves, eventually. No one nation "won it" but there has been too much historical revisionism eagerly abetted by the great American encyclopeadia known as "Hollywood" leading people eager to hand the responsibility to the USA.

What's that got to do with the price of eggs? Are all these hundreds of thousands of people ex-servicemen? Did they all fly in the Battle of Britain? Plenty of people from the Imperial colonies fought - in a more official capacity than the Polish pilots, often as conscripts and dying in far greater numbers numbers - for the UK in the War, but we don't have an open borders policy with regards to those countries... What is so hard to understand? Immigration policy should take little or no account of the individual's country of origin. It's simple: No English? No skills or reasonable chance of supporting yourself? Criminal record? Religious nut? Sorry, no entry for you. Immigration policy is easy. Only politicians could fuck it up so badly...

Europe is a total betrayal of the young people of the UK. You're asking 16-18 YO Brits straight out of school to compete for jobs with Poles in their 20s, with experience under their belts. These people take the jobs - jobs that were always the preserve of spotty teens like waitressing, cleaning and bar work - for a few years, then go back home taking their savings and skills with them. Meanwhile, the young English working class have simply been denied their first job and are left struggling to make a living. Amazing that the "left" would support such a pernicious policy, that suits big pubcos and large corporations at the expense of working class children.

I wanted to show that these people are not dolesucking subhumans as has been conveyed in this very thread but that they are also desirable and hardworking. But yes, it was also my intention to remind the original poster of this particular joy of multiculturalism - the sexual one - since it so rarely appears in the discourse. I am of course well aware that other considerations apply to how we organise our societies beyond those most conducive to my own personal dick-placement. By the way, I ran my post past my Greek partner then showed her your post. She is contemptuous of your characterisation of my words as sexist.

Just as many immigrants or more are entering other European countries as the UK. Germany has far more Polish immigrants than the UK. Europe in terms of world migration gets 2% of it. As for Romania and Bulgarians most of them are more likely to go to countries closer to their own with similar languages. A lot of this talk about immigration is to create a hype and narrative that there is more of a problem than there really is. As for the census I don't completely believe it, some of the details don't make sense.

The Poles are excellent news for the UK as a whole but I don't expect many in the building industry, on a personal level, to agree.

Who would have thought that you would now have the likes of Kwasi Kwarteng given a platform in this paper to moan that his farmer mates in Norfolk simply can't find British workers willing to reduce their expectations to Eastern European standards. Of course whilst some Tories get all concerned for the plucky British worker unable to compete with cheap labour from abroad I don't think I have ever heard a Tory complain about an employer shutting shop and moving abroad in search of cheap labour in fact that was the end result of most of Thatcher's industrial privatisations.

A while back the Daily Mail made a bit of break with tradition and did a piece on the growing number of Middle Class Brits moving to Poland. According to the Daily Mail "As the Mail reported yesterday, a new study suggests Poland’s quality of life is significantly better than Britain’s, primarily because of lower crime, violence and living costs. Not to mention that Poles have on average ten more days’ holiday a year — and nearly 200 more hours of sunshine." Perhaps ending unrestricted travel in Europe won't be quite such good news for Brits as the Little Englanders would have us believe?

A increasingly noisy politically motivated faction is always frothing at the mouth about leaving the EU, but they don't want to tell you or have you examine too closely the consequences such an act would render. Such as the fact that 53% of all UK exports are bought by other EU countries and the UK imports about 160 billion pounds in products and luxury goods from other EU countries; and that unbalancing the free market trade agreements the EU provide would cause the UK's GDP to be permanently lowered. Such as the fact that approximately 750,000 Brits live/work somewhere else in the EU, and if we start sending their people back to them they may well send ours back to us. So if anyone thought we'd be saving money on services and benefits, forget it. And the biggest fact, isolating the UK from the EU will make foreign investors very nervous and they'll go spend their money and open their business and develop land somewhere else, and the already struggling economy will struggle even more. I can understand wanting to put some revised guidelines, perhaps even immigration quotas, in place, but a total severing of ties with the EU will be a death knell for the UK pure and simple. Too much is riding on the survival of the country to ever make leaving realistic. And for those who think the UK has the clout to threaten to leave and make the EU capitulate will be able to hear the laughter all the way from Brussels.

The population has increased by 4 million in the past 10 years, true enough but you are conveniently forgetting the 700,000 or so babies that are born each year. Once you take away the 400,00 deaths each year, you are left with a net gain of c.300,000 and 300,000 times a decade leads us to a net population gain of 3 million from the balance of births and deaths. So at most its 1 million and in a nation of 63million thats a fairly small whack.

I was going to say that 1/22 million households without the local language as a "main language" seems quite low in these global days. People are mobile now. Non-native speakers I know where I live (Germany) often only have German as the "main household language" if we hook up with a local or other non-German / English speaker. But even then it's not a given because your partner may have English. The other reason is if you have kids and they get educated in local systems. I don't think it's a big deal myself. As I said, many people here manage without the local language. Personally I think it makes life harder and less enjoyable in the longer-term but it's "horses for courses" really.

They will be well-off pensioners who have invested in a property out there and wish to spend the rest of their days drinking Sangria, playing golf and leathering their skin in the sun. This benefits the Spanish economy and ordinary Spaniards. You're not going to see 16-25 year old Brits with no money head over to a country whose youth unemployment is around 50%. Whereas with the Polish coming over here, it is mainly the younger age bracket seeking employment in the UK as the wage is much much higher than what they'd be earning back home. Unfortunately, what can happen is someone arrives from Poland and works their arse off for a few years, living in pretty dire conditions and saving every penny, and then heading back home with what in their own currency would be a small fortune. This a) means the unskilled British worker misses out on a job b) keeps the minimum wage low as the Polish are more than happy to work for that (or less) c) does no good for the British economy as the money earned here leaves the country.

How are migrants pushing the wages down if there is a minimum wage? Unless you are saying that the wage for low-skilled jobs would be above the minimum wage if there wasnt the increased competition from foreigners? This would of course require a significant excess of demand over supply - funnily governments tackle such excess normally by bringing migrants in to avoid wages inflating for unskilled jobs. In any event for the effect to be substantial the excess would have to be enourmous (we are talking rebuilding after war for example). And that the minimum wage is amongst the lowest here in the world is simply false. You may want to get a new globe that has more than 5 countries on it.

In some northern cities there have been Polish clubs for decades..I think the current problems stem from the arrival of Poles into areas which have had no previous interaction with them and no integrated community. Poles are nothing new in Britain. My own grandfather was one of the exiles from Monte Cassino. But you can't educate the brainless. And I can tell you that Polish is one hell of a hard language to learn.

Britain was part of that conspiracy, we only have ourselves - or rather our degenerate ruling and business classes - to blame. That's what creted the relatively cheap E. European labour pool.

So it annoys me when people treat language-learning as this simple courtesy immigrants are supposed to do - it's just good manners etc. Obviously immigrants should try their level best, but the natives should remember that even a barely comprehensible pidgin English learned by someone from Africa could well represent a massive effort, a massive achievement, and indeed, that a standard of Greek (mine) even worse than that ALSO represents a hell of a lot of brain-busting effort!

This type of language is often part of the skills of the 'uneducated' native Brits who it is so fashionable to point out don't even speak their own language 'properly' ,that is, they don't speak/ write the formal (Latinate) English that a good polish education seems to give its people.

The allied forces absorbed them into the forces that existed- sensibly. Most probably fought bravely and well and in the end the whole allied effort defeated fascism in Europe. Good.

The left should be ashamed. The middle class people who read the Guardian don't understand this. They think "well now my cleaner works for less money, isn't that progress for me" and "let them eat cake! I can go work in Europe now". Neither of which "advantage" applied to the working class who now simply find they have more competition for every job.

Perhaps people come to the UK because of work opportunities that aren't being filled locally due to changes in the proportion of those working/retired, a lack of desire to do menial tasks (as quality of life in a country improves, people are less and less willing to do these) or a lack of skills among the local population. The only one of those that could be practically addressed by Government is education and training although raising the retirement age will have some effect. Perhaps some kind of Logun's Run approach... All I'm saying is there will always be vacancies for those willing to work and have the necessary skills to do so, wherever they come from.

And in turn, had employers not had an extra 4 million people to choose from they would have had to increase wages to get someone to do that menial work?

I know people in construction and IT who are competing for jobs against people who are willing to work for less and it definitely makes it harder. However, without any immigration, there would still be a huge skill gap as people try to improve on the lives their parents had and generally live well beyond retirement age. Those remaining to fill less desirable roles will be able to charge more for less quality and still won't be able to fill the demand. Immigration is generally the easiest way to address this shortcoming. Although a few countries are paying families to get baby booming.

There is NOT a finite number of jobs in an economy. The more people there are, the higher demand for jobs and services there is, the more jobs are created. If there was then why has France (which didn’t let the Poles in first off) consistently had a much higher rate of unemployment than the UK? In general immigrants are not in competition with native workers for jobs either (a) because they’re doing stuff like toilet cleaning and working in abattoirs that the native born turn their noses up at or (b) because they’ve have skills that the native born don’t possess enough of whether that’s in plumbing or in IT or in investment banking. It’s true that in some industries immigrants push the wages down for native born workers, to which the obvious response is the one Ed Miliband has proposed, i.e. a decent living wage. And it’s not just the middle class that can benefit from immigration - to put it bluntly if your local council had to pay a British person £25 an hour to clean the office then everyone’s council tax goes up, if a farmer had to pay a Briton more to pick produce then the price of food for everyone goes up. To be honest, the entry of women into the workplace has had more impact on the lot of the white working class than immigrants (there being more women than immigrants) but I don’t suppose you’re recommending that we all disappear back into the kitchen so that working class male wages can rise?

Employers are bound by the minimum wage. This may not be ideal (as I have experienced in my life at some points in the past) but it is the same for an English employee or a migrant worker. If this is not paid the employer is breaking the law & should be the target of your anger. 2. Does an English worker justify a higher wage? Are their rights greater than others. The answer is NO. I work in a global company & I would be horrified to find that I am being paid higher for an equal skilled employee here in the UK based upon my citizenship. 3.I have done some crappy jobs in my life and many at the same time. I remember working in a shop 9-5 Mon to Sat, then working as a kitchen porter on Fri night, Sat night & all day Sun to survive. As a result I was able to set up my own company.

Eastern Europeans got the jobs because they were far cheaper to employ and far easier to exploit than the natives, certainly at the unskilled end anyway. They were cheaper because they were happy to slum it for a year or two and save up money which would be worth far more back home.

I'm not recommending it, just noting that that's what tends to happen in all countries for as long as there have been settlements and people to emigrate to them. A better solution would be to move away from the idea that everyone needs to work to survive (rather work should be a vocation), use money as a medium of exchange rather than treat it as some kind of god (people don't die from lack of money, they die from poor health, lack of food/water, etc.). Automate production where possible and provide enough to sustain our needs (rather than producing less than demand to keep the value high), restrict population growth (if everyone had one kid for a couple of generations, this would pretty much be solved).

I also have noticed that regardss of how well they actually speak English, they continue do so with veru think Polish accent which makes it difficult for native-English speakers to communicate with them, thus hindering and significant integration.n a sense, they are already more "integrated" than most other migrant populations, such as those from Asia and Africa, simply because they are white, European and Christian.

In this respect Poles in the UK and Ireland are quite similar to Western expats in the Arabian Gulf countries. Mostly, they come for a short time, not intending to put down any roots or 'integrate' into the culture, but simply to make as much money as possible, send it home on a monthly basis and leave as soon as they've saved enough. So for the most part, they live and socialise amongst themselves, sticking to their own habits and customs as much as they can.

OMG !!! Not again !!! Look, I will make this very, very, very clear OK !!!. I initially responded to a very simple comment where someone said that Poles had been integrating very well in this country. . . . and I made the very relevant observation that the Polish by and large blend in quite well with the native British population which could surely give one the impression that they are in fact integrating when they are not. Geez, how many times am I going to have to explain myself !!! Obviously there are many different ways that people can and can not integrate, a Polish person might not stand out of place anywhere in Britain but at the very same time might not at all be integrating in any way, and there is really NO way that anyone would be able to tell that they actually were or not. Whereas, and to give an extreme example, a Muslim woman in a burqa, she would most definitely stand out almost anywhere in Britain and would be a very good sign that perhaps Muslims are not integrating. Understand ??? Just because people speak with an accent doesn't mean they are not integrating. Well I have met various Europeans with almost flawless English accents, which are of course extreme examples of people integrating so well into British culture that they sound exactly like the locals. I worked in London for a while where my colleagues were almost all entirely non-British and non-native English speakers. They themselves would usually only encounter other non-native English speakers on a day to day basis, and I did notice that even though their English improved over time, their accents remained as thick as when they first arrived. Now, it can of course be quite difficult for non-native English speakers to integrate into British culture in a place like London, especially since the culture there is predominantly international, but the fact remains that their accents remained strong because they were not encountering and conversing with enough native English speakers. I understand that some non-native speakers will always retain a strong accent no matter how long they have been in an English speaking country or how much they converse with native-English speakers, however the fact that so many Poles that I speak with still have very strong accents, quite plainly suggests to me that they are not conversing with native-English speaking Britons on a very regular basis and are therefor not really integrating that well into British society. It's just the ever dissatisfied people like you who will make people jump through more and more hoops that make it seem so. I am not dissatisfied with anything, I am merely stating my opinion that the majority of Poles might not actually be integrating as well as some other people may believe them to be. What exactly would be, according to your standards, an acceptable level of integration? OMG !!! There is no acceptable level of integration, people are either integrated or not, or only just a bit, it is what it is. I am not the one that is setting or even mentioning any standards whatsoever, that is all you my friend. And why on Earth can't Poles spend their money on Polish food in Polish shops? These shops are businesses paying taxes in the UK. What is your objection to that? I DON'T HAVE ANY OBJECTION TO POLES SPENDING THEIR MONEY ON POLISH FOOD IN POLISH SHOPS !!! But what I am saying is that the fact that so many Polish specialty stores exist in the UK now might, and let me just say that once again in case you didn't get it the first time, might be a good indicator that the Polish are not integrating VERY WELL in this country. Look, I don't really know how well Poles are actually integrating, no one knows, no one will ever know !!! But what we CAN do is make observations and educated guesses based on those observations as to whether they are or not. One person potentially made an educated guess that the Poles were integrating very well based on what I assume was their individual observations and I countered that educated guess with an educated guess of my own based on my own personal observations where I stated that I think, no, they are not integrating very well . . . . . . wow, I'm so sorry for having an opinion.

I think they've managed immigration very badly for all sorts of reasons but mostly because the Brits do not all have the same experiences or the same way of thinking. Nevertheless, I think it is true that there is widespread concern that, as John Cleese recently put it, that in certain parts of the country there no longer seems to be a 'parent culture'. Others clearly feel this is great either because they hated the parent culture or were never part of it and had their own. Yet others ( foolishly in my view) imagine that somehow that parent culture will somehow win out in the end regardless. These people are still caught up in an imperial way of thinking whereby the British are in some kind of noblesse oblige role. These people are mostly lefftwing liberals,and would reject any notion of imperialist attitudes in themselves. They try very hard to avoid their innate racism by externalising it on to hate figures like Enoch Powell or John Terry. they feel that if they chant 'racist' regularly at others they will avoid suspicion falling on themselves,deflect suspicion on themselves and somehow purge their souls of the thing they most fear.Although they talk endlessly about embracing diversity they show no willingness to discuss difference and treat cultures as if they were expressed most significantly in food and styles of dress. I'm sorry if you seem to provoke crestfallen faces but from what you say this is probably because the person is disappointed that they haven't guessed correctly rather than than that they discover you're Polish. Report Share this comment on Twitter Share this comment on Facebook golfstrom WasterofTime 31 January 2013 1:26pm Recommend 0 @WasterofTime - I do appreciate the fact that in most people's perception minorities are much more visible and therefore the feeling is that the change is so rapid that there is indeed some sort of invasion. I can really understand the confusion and maybe fear. I can also understand using the most common defense mechanisms (mainly negative stereotyping and expecting that other cultures make themselves less visible for instance by demanding to use only English in public places). But let's stereotype with a bit more self-awareness. Just because well educated, generally civilised and fairly well integrated Poles are not easily spotted on the street it doesn't mean that they don't exist in this country. The culture of this country is not threatened by the immigration. The culture of this country is in a constant negotiation and immigration is a part of it. How is this country's community culture more affected by immigration than it is affected by social mobility within British ethnic groups? Integration is not only about the immigrants wanting to connect to the British culture. It is also about the Brits wanting to connect with the immigrants. And believe me, those who want, and thankfully there are many, generally have the same experience as with mixing with other human groups. You meet odd ones and painfully boring ones, intelligent ones and thick as a brick ones, racist ones and open minded ones, extremely social ones and shy ones. Generally honest ones and generally shady ones. We do not come in one size. Perhaps this is what is lacking from this discussion about the parent culture - suspending your own fear to see for yourself who your Polish neighbour really is. And remembering that it's a bit like with men: just because you met an asshole once or twice does not mean all men are twats ;) and does not mean you won't meet one ever again. I wish I could believe that your last conclusion was true. Alas I have a friend who moved here well before 2004 when she was 17. She came here to a boarding school, then she studied biology in Edinburgh, then she did her masters in law. Because of her age people assume she's from the EU wave of immigration. Even she is surprised with a sudden flip from cold reserve to a warm welcoming tone when she reveals that she's not part of the post EU access immigration. If people start a conversation with prejudice, that's fine. As I said stereotyping is a natural thing to do. But if they finish a conversation with the same prejudice for the exception of that one person they were talking to, than this is just wrong and they need to sort themselves out.

I don't think it really helps to call anyone who is concerned about immigration a bigot though. It's a knee-jerk reaction that fails to take into account the fact that mass immigration does bring with it problems that the country needs to work hard to solve. Racism is still with us, but then on the other hand so are issues such as the self-segregation of some migrant communities, lack of language skills, "white flight", and the importation of traditions like forced marriage and female genital mutilation that are not wanted here. And all this without getting into the debate about the country's services: taken on its own (because it is where most immigrants want to live,) England, as distinct from the UK, already has a higher population density than any EU state except for the Netherlands. Coping with an ever-increasing population (and growing linguistic diversity along with it) is a burden on housing, healthcare, transportation infrastructure and especially the school system that we all have to live with. I'm sure that the revelation that almost a third of the entire population of the West Midlands no longer speaks good English is a gift for wags who want to crack silly jokes at the expense of Brummies, but it is genuinely shocking. How on Earth are we supposed to build properly integrated communities in this country in areas where a very large minority of the population lacks the ability to undertake sophisticated dialogue with everyone else? If people come into the country at a manageable rate then they can spread out through the rest of the population, those who need help with issues such as improving their language skills can get it, and we can integrate properly. If you get them turning up in great waves then the tendency will always be for people who have a lot in common to congregate together in enclaves - so you end up with cultural and linguistic ghettos, especially in the major cities, where much of the population feels no imperative to take any interest in what is happening in the wider community. This just promotes the atomisation of our society, and is no-one's best interests.

Take the recent and disturbing trend in hardline Muslim vigilantism on the streets of certain parts of London, and in particular the fact that these people have been caught going after gays. For the anti-Tory culture warriors, both people from ethnic and religious minorities and gay people are to be celebrated, because conservative-minded types tend not to be all that keen on immigration (and can therefore, in the anti-Tory world view, be accused of racism - a favourite ploy) and many right-wingers get very hot under the collar about gay equality as well. So, when some extremist Muslims go around on the streets wantonly threatening gays, it presents an insoluble dilemma. If you side with poor innocent gay men being abused openly in the street by these revolting people (no prizes for guessing which side I'm on over this one) then you are forced, logically, to concede that diversity of belief is not, at all times and in all places, an entirely good thing. Moreover, since Islamist fundamentalism in the UK was imported from abroad, this also implies that some migrants have done more harm than good. These are both things which right-wing people have been saying for a very long time, but you can't be seen to be agreeing with anything that they claim because it must be racist. However, if you refuse to condemn the vigilanties then you are, logically, condoning hate crimes against the gay community. This is patently unjust, panders to extremely nasty ultra-conservative religious prejudices, and is blatantly homophobic. In the anti-Tory culture warrior world view, because the vigilanties aren't white British Christians or secular people then you can't condemn them without concluding that migration can have negative consequences and that not all members of minority groups are nice people, which would make you a hateful racist Tory. But you can't not condemn them because failing to do so would make you a hateful gay-bashing Tory. So, therefore, you daren't think about it for too long, because it would not compute and your head would explode.

I hope your issues can be resolved but I don't see your venom toward those that are able to come here to live and work though, as they are legally entitled to do so as part of the EU, along with the Germans, French, Italian, Spanish and other nations that no one seems to mind. There is a definite attitude toward those from nations that Brits seem to know less about. Others have quoted here very well that most Poles move here to work, usually with a view to saving to eventually move home and buy or build a house. When Brits do this is Saudi or other countries we think nothing of it, good on them, but we resent it of others coming here. Those people coming here do not take British jobs, they take jobs in Britain. If British people were the best for the available jobs, they would lock out the labour market, but compared to most other European nations we are generally very lazy and have a very poor work ethic. Employers are able to pick the best person for the job and if presented with a hard working well educated foreign national or a poorly educated slack Brit, we would all pick the former. Remember too, there is minimum wage here, and those that think that Poles will work for less, the usual "working for peanuts" trash quote springs to mind, are fooling themselves.

The situation is that there are a number of spouses of British nationals who are not allowed to come to the UK. The number is fairly small at around 2,000+. However, 99% of those spouses and the British counterparts are in the high earning bracket. They would not qualify for benefits if the came and would not need them. They would pay huge amounts in tax. They are often from English-speaking countries with a flair for the language (not struggling in broken English to make themselves understood). They are virtually all young and in perfect health. They would be an asset to any country except the UK. Meanwhile the non-EU spouses of of EU nationals are allowed to come here along with millions of EU nationals. They are not high fliers but tend to take unskilled or sem-skilled jobs supplemented by benefits and are high users of all the services. You say it is the law: does that make it right? Why should families be broken up to accommodate the surge in immigration from Europe. If my niece returns, where is her child supposed to live. They may not be able to stay in Australia and the child can't come here. Is she supposed to drown in the ocean because of the law?

They do not need to worry about that because they get housing benefit, child benefit even for children abroad, tax credits, often just to the front of the queue for health services and use the schools. I use none of those. I just keep paying not only my way but for everybody else as well.

The opinion is that the change in the law on 9 July 2012 is deeply flawed and is bound to be reversed. There is no sign of that happening and it is more likely that the rules will be tightened even further. Aside from the injustice (which I would not rely on), the economic stupidity is amazing. These people are all young, high fliers and in good health. They would not be a burden on anybody barring an unforeseen and extremely unlikely event. However, in order to limit immigration, they are being locked out and families torn apart. If my niece did return with her daughter without her husband, then she would could be a burden on the state. Presumably, that is why the daughter is locked out. It amazes me how commenters on here think that is OK but at the same time think it is OK to support millions of immigrants and their third-country families. People keep on saying it is the law. It is a LOOPHOLE in the law that allows third-country spouses and families of EU nationals in here. I know quite a few who are claiming three lots of housing and other benefits (wife and two teenage children, in turn having a child they can't support). The typical scenario is that these marriages fail as soon as they arrive in Britain yet they are entitled to stay here on full benefits.

She cannot come without her husband anyway as she would have no means of support with a 2-year old child: if she were Polish she could claim benefits or if she were Polish she could bring her Australian husband in without question. Do you think that is right? The crux of the matter is that her return is being blocked - lawfully or unlawfully - by the British government because Britain is overcrowded. What should happen is that entry should be refused to all the Polish and other peoples coming here but instead they are not only assisted by a benefits system but those who have a right to be here are locked out.

One of the biggest myths is that immigrants (such as myself) only come here as unskilled workers for low paid jobs. This is simply not true.

I understand that your niece is British, living in Aus, and she is having trouble moving back here with her Aus husband. However, if your niece was Polish (not British) they would face the same issues re: her Aus husband, wouldnt' they?

I've looked up the post 2012 rules. Thy're not very nice, but they don't favour the non-EEA spouses of non-Brit EEA citizens. If I had an immig. problem, I wouldn't use pricey City solicitors who are probably used to importing high-income banksters and the like. I'd look for a solicitor or immigration advocate around Heathrow, the East End or wherever London Ozzies live these days. If your nephew-in-law is being obstructed illegally, including less favourable discretionary treatment under ECHR art. 14, make a stink.

For the umpteenth time, an EU citizen (not British) can bring their non-EU spouse into the UK to live and work and use the benefits system. There are none as blind as those who don't want to see. I have made my posts crystal clear - and clearly touched a raw nerve because half of them have been deleted. It is hopeless commenting in this newspaper because it is full of twisted bigots.

You are twisting the facts to support your views. You state: My niece is married to an Australian (who has some British ancestry, ie grandfather, and is English mother tongue which he speaks better anybody you mention). She cannot bring him back to the UK without meeting draconian conditions Now, if your niece was Polish, living in Australia and married to an Australian, she would be in exactly the same (if not worse) position. an EU citizen (not British) can bring their non-EU spouse into the UK to live and work and use the benefits system. Only if their spouse has become a permanent resident of that EU country by living and working there for 5 years. So, really, what you are upset about is that Polish people have more of a right to live here than Australians. In my opinion, it's perfectly reasonable that Polish people have more of a right to live here than Australians, given we have a reciprocal free trade and movement of labour agreement with them. Maybe you should be campaigning for Australia to join the EU?

A person of non-EU nationality (eg Australia, America, India, Canada), who marries an EU national eg Spain, France, Italy etc, takes on that country's nationality and is thus entitled under EU law to live and work in the UK. I know quite a number of them who are doing just that even though they split up as soon as they arrived and are now divorced.

You are twisting the facts to support your views. At least you are finally admitting that you are calling me a liar by engaging in convoluted arguments. A Polish or other EU national should not have greater rights in the UK than a British person yet they currently do. My niece cannot bring her Australian husband (and child) to live here with her. An EU national (including Polish national) can bring their Australian husband (and child) to live here with them. That cannot be right and that is what I am saying. If you are alleging that this is twisted, try taking a course in English. That is maybe where your problem in understanding lies.

I have re-produced one of them and it has sitll not been deleted! I think I will have my say in a better quality newspaper where English is understood. Report Share this comment on Twitter Share this comment on Facebook efmcandrew finsicle 01 February 2013 2:42pm Recommend 0 @finsicle - I forgot to tell though I have said it elsewhere: my niece's husband's mother is Austrian. She has an Austrian passport and did not adopt Australian nationality though she has lived there since she was two. She can come to the UK as and EU citizen. She can bring her long-term Australian partner also. If my niece's husband's father (not mother) were Austrian and not Australian, then my niece's husband could come. Thus, the children of EU passport holders are deemed here to have the father's nationality. The same applies to Australian passport holders, as regards the UK.

There were already a sizable number of Poles who came here after the War, fearing a return to their now(then) Soviet-run country. I have no problem with the numbers. What I do take issue with is New Labour's bullshit predictions. Clearly bollocks and unrealistic, given the post-war history of migration and tradition (ever visited Ealing in the 90's?).

(Although British women don't feel the need to point this out, but here the balance needs redressing). Who'll quite likely end up with an English wife. My o/h is Polish, which also means I know a lot of other Polish men. (We don't live in the UK.) Lots of extremely attractive Polish men all over Europe. Report Share this comment on Twitter Share this comment on Facebook KrustytheKlown hottentotten 30 January 2013 5:07pm Recommend 5 @oommph I'm not sure if many Poles (of either gender) end up with British wives/husbands. Most seem to marry other Poles - indeed, many of them are married, or in serious relationships, before they arrive in the UK. Agree with your other point though: the stereotypical notion that all Polish women are babes and all Polish men are fugly is nonsense. Lots of gorgeous Polish men, and lots of plain Polish women. Trouble is, none of them age well. In my experience, even the most gorgeous young Poles lose their allure by the ripe old age of 35 or so.

But can I ask if you work in a profession where you're likely to lose your job to an immigrant? It's all very well and good talking about the supposed joys of Polish food (really?) but increased competition for unskilled work isn't such fun to those suffering from it.

Albeit I moved to the UK as a child in the early 80s. You're assumption is correct, I work as a professional in London, not as an unskilled worker.

My point was that I value and enjoy living amongst a mix of people and cultures. I don't view the white, english, protestant culture as something that has a divine right to be in the majority, for ever more. And when I read articles about the amount of people born outside the UK, or speaking another language, I, personally, see it is a positive thing.

An autoworker in the US, for example, can see their job move a mile across the border to Canada -- but not be allowed to follow it because of immigration restrictions. However, mangement-level employees, the cars and money are free to move across the border.
