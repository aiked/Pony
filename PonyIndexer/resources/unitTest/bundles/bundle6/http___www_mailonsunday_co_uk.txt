Couple paid �500,000 for tumble-down cottage only to demolish it and build a stunning �1.5m cliffside holiday home Alex Michaelis and Susanna Bell from west London raised eyebrows when they spent the large sum on an overgrown home with no heating or electricity (top and bottom left) near Penzance, Cornwall, in 2009 - but despite it being on top of a cliff which is slowly eroding away, they knocked down the three-bed cottage and built an ultra-modern house (inset) in its place. The new home, finished in 2012, includes modern interiors (top and bottom right) and is powered by solar panels and a ground source heat pump. It is designed in such a way that every large window faces the sea - and even has space for a hammock (centre). The couple let out the home to holidaymakers for up to �5,000 a week and it is worth a reputed �1.5million. Ms Bell, 43, said: 'The council said we were completely mad'.

He was used as a 'frontman', knocking on doors claiming to have lost a toy or that he needed to borrow a pencil and paper. As he distracted kind-spirited victims, an accomplice would break in and steal as much cash and jewellery as they could carry. Pictured right are the boy's accomplices Michael Doran and Geraldine Ward, who were jailed earlier this month for their role in the burglary spree. Ward is also pictured (right) using a stolen card at a cashpoint.

The three youngsters had begged their parents for the treehouse and were over the moon when it was completed. But just days later, Mr and Mrs Bosma received a letter from South Holland District Council, warning the couple to tear down the structure because it required planning permission.
